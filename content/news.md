Based in Shanghai, Simone is a designer of future products and stories. He works with companies and organizations such as Dubai's Museum of the Future, BMW, and Google Creative Lab to speculate and prototype future experiences. His work has been exhibited in museums around the world such as Vitra Design Museum and MAK Vienna.

Simone is interested in exploring stories from unexpected, mundane, and non-human perspectives. Recently, together with his collective automato.farm, he collaborated with Bruce Sterling to build an immersive VR storytelling installation for the audience experience life from the perspective of household devices.

NERVEMILK will translate and publish selected stories from Simone’s short fiction collection on Medium called Approximately Tomorrow (https://medium.com/approximately-tomorrow). The stories are often inspired by Simone's daily experience in Shanghai, which to him can be at times more surreal than science fiction.


Simone 是一名生活在上海的未来主义设计师。他曾与迪拜未来博物馆、宝马 、以及谷歌创意实验室等机构合作。他的作品曾经展出于德国维特拉博物馆和维也纳应用美术馆。

Simone对未来的关注点常常来自日常生活或非人类视角。近期他与著名科幻小说家布鲁斯·斯特令合作的装置作品，通过虚拟现实技术, 从家居用品视角进行叙事。

神经奶将翻译部分Simone的短篇作品，这些作品选自他在线上发布的未来主义短篇集——明日将近。这些故事的创作初衷往往源于他在上海生活的日常，有时他会觉得他目前生活的周遭要比他想象的未来要科幻许多许多。
